Ans 4. When writing a query  there are keywords which actually represent the subject of the query, it's a word or a token about which we are talking about and sometimes the other non relevant words or
	tokens come into the picture(weigh in) and increase the cosine similarity with the  irrelevant document as compared to the document which is about the main subject.
	
Ans 5. I would prefer using weighting scheme 1. Since the number of relevant documents I got using weighting scheme1 are higher than the number of relevant documents for weighting scheme2. The reason, 
	this is occuring is because of the fraction in weighting scheme2, there is tf in the numerator and denominator as well, so the affect of tf is kind of nullified, whereas in the weighting scheme
	1 we have tf in the numerator only, and I guess that is making the difference
Ans 6. I used a 2 dimensional dictionary in python to create a vector over the documents. The first dimension is the lemma found in the documents and the second dimension is the document.Thus, each
	cell in the 2-D dictionary is the tf of the word in the given document.
	
	For weighting scheme 1, when calculating score for the query I have taken 
	a)"tf" -term frequency of the lemma in the query
	b)"collectionSize"- number of documents
	c)"max_tf"- the maximum term frequency of any lemma in the given query 
	d)"df"-df of the word in the documents
	
	For weighting scheme 2 ,when calculating score for the query I have taken
	a)"tf" -term frequency of the lemma in the query
	b)"collectionSize"- number of documents
	c)"doclen"-length of the query
	d)"avgDoclen"-average length of the query
	e)"df"-df of the word in the documents
